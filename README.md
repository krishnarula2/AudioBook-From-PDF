# 📖 Make Audiobook from Any PDF using Python

This Python project converts any PDF into an audiobook using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. It’s a simple yet impactful tool that reads the content of a PDF aloud — perfect for accessibility, learning on the go, or turning textbooks into spoken word.

## 🔧 Features

- 📂 Select any PDF file using a file dialog
- 🗣️ Automatically extracts and reads all text using `pyttsx3`
- 🔄 Loops through every page in the document
- ✅ Works offline (no internet required)

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Listening to eBooks and documents hands-free
- Making reading accessible for visually impaired users
- Studying while multitasking
- Building the foundation for more advanced audio processing apps

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed and the following packages:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 PyPDF2

Running the App:
python audiobook.py

📁 Code Overview

import pyttsx3
import PyPDF2
from tkinter.filedialog import *

book = askopenfilename()
pdfreader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(book)
pages = len(pdfreader.pages)

for num in range(0, pages):
    page = pdfreader.pages[num]
    text = page.extract_text()
    player = pyttsx3.init()
    player.say(text)
    player.runAndWait()
